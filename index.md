<h1 class="h1" style="color: rgb(0,0,0)" id="about"> ABOUT ME </h1>

Hi there! I’m Jeesung Ahn, a postdoctoral fellow at the [Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/centers/communication-neuroscience-lab), working with [Dr. Emily Falk](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/emily-falk-phd). I’m passionate about using data and science to make a positive impact on people’s lives!

My research primarily focuses on understanding and enhancing social connections, tackling loneliness, and improving mental health. I’m particularly interested in identifying factors that increase the risk of loneliness and understanding the brain’s role in our social connections and isolation.

Additionally, I build models to evaluate how behavioral interventions can promote healthier behaviors, such as increasing physical activity. By leading multidisciplinary research projects, I aim to develop personalized strategies to enhance both physical and mental well-being.

As a health psychologist and neuroscientist, I strive to bridge the gap between data-driven insights and real-world applications, contributing to a healthier and more connected society.

**Research Areas**: Social Connections, Loneliness, Mental Health, Health Persuasion, Behavioral Interventions, Behavior Change, Brain-as-Predictor, Brain-Behavior Relationships

<h1 class="h1" style="color: rgb(0,0,0)" id="methods summary"> RESEARCH METHODS  </h1>

Over the past 9+ years, I have led comprehensive psychology and neuroscience research projects, focusing on human behavioral and neuroimaging data.

My research methods are multi-disciplinary and include the followings: 
- Experimental and survey design (including A/B tests, usability tests)
- Data collection (recruiting, screening, surveys, experimental, behavioral, neuroimaging, experience sampling, in-depth interviews)
- Descriptive, parametric, non-parametric, and multivariate statistics
- Regression analysis (e.g., general linear modeling)
- Multilevel modeling
- Time-series analysis
- Signal processing (e.g., denoising, despiking, temporal filtering of fMRI signals)
- Computational network analysis (brain networks, social networks)
- Machine learning (supervised and unsupervised)
- Meta-analysis of multidimensional datasets
- Qualitative content analysis (including text analysis)

These methods allow me to conduct thorough and rigorous research, contributing valuable insights to the fields of psychology and neuroscience.

In this extensive mega-analysis of neuroimaging (fMRI) and physical activity behavioral datasets (N=366), I found that the effectiveness of health message interventions in promoting physical activity can be predicted by the interplay between message characteristics (e.g., gain vs. loss framing) and individual factors (e.g., baseline physical activity levels).

My goal was to create a data-driven algorithm that provides personalized food recommendations based on an individual’s dietary needs. I performed exploratory data analyses and unsupervised machine learning (PCA, K-means clustering) on a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/nutrient-data/canadian-nutrient-file-2015-download-files.html">dataset</a> with 5690 (food) x 154 (nutrients) dimensions. This approach allowed me to cluster the food items into 8 distinct categories and simulate real-world scenarios to provide tailored food recommendations for individuals with dietary restrictions.

This study explored how internal self-perception and social networks relate to loneliness. We recruited 111 participants from various university social groups and used a round-robin design to measure social connectedness. Key variables included self-liking, bidirectional social connectedness, and structural characteristics of social networks, such as size and modularity. Using structural equation modeling, I found that higher self-liking significantly correlated with reduced loneliness, making it the most significant predictor. Larger social networks were also associated with lower levels of loneliness. Interestingly, perceived connectedness with peers and network modularity did not significantly predict loneliness levels. These findings highlight the importance of positive self-perception and extensive social networks in mitigating loneliness among younger adults, suggesting new directions for interventions.

In this study, I developed a machine learning model to predict individual loneliness levels among college students (N = 107) using whole-brain functional connectivity networks. Participants viewed socially relevant stimuli (peer faces) inside an fMRI scanner. The results showed that loneliness could be predicted from functional connectivity patterns across eight brain systems. Key features included connectivity between the frontoparietal control, default mode, dorsal and ventral attention, visual, and somatomotor systems. Higher loneliness was linked to increased cross-modal connectivity between higher-order and lower-order systems, while lower loneliness correlated with greater connectivity within unimodal sensory-perceptual systems and the default mode system. These findings highlight potential neural markers of loneliness and suggest that brain functional connectivity, especially within the frontoparietal control and visual systems, is a significant predictor of loneliness.

I tested whether neural responses to peers' faces could predict changes in loneliness from before to after the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings indicated that lonelier individuals might place greater emotional importance on self-relevant social stimuli. Additionally, those who exhibited higher reward sensitivity to peers' faces were more likely to experience increased loneliness during the pandemic.

In this large-scale, multidisciplinary study, we used a Round Robin design to recruit entire members of campus social groups. Participants rated their own and their peers’ social status, including factors like likability, attractiveness, and influence. I focused on three key questions: 1) Is there a discrepancy between how individuals evaluate their own social status versus how their peers evaluate it? 2) Is under- or over-evaluating one’s social status associated with poorer mental health? 3) Is under- or over-evaluating one’s social status linked to greater consideration of others' thoughts and feelings?

<div class="column" markdown="1"> I designed and conducted A/B tests for a mobile application aimed at providing cognitive training to modify attentional bias towards negative social stimuli (Attentional Bias Modification, ABM). To test the app, I recruited healthy controls, individuals with social anxiety, and call center workers experiencing high emotional stress at their workplaces. Participants performed the ABM task both inside an fMRI scanner and on their smartphones. We used machine-learning classification of brain functional connectivity networks during the ABM task and discovered that socially distressed individuals exhibited an attentional bias towards negative faces (compared to neutral faces) at both behavioral and neural levels.

I conducted a qualitative review of literature examining the effects of interventions designed to address two major public health concerns: physical inactivity and loneliness. My goal was to identify which aspects of these interventions most effectively improve physical activity and/or reduce loneliness, and to explore whether these two variables are bi-directionally related. I proposed a psychological framework suggesting that positive social experiences may underlie the relationship between loneliness and physical activity.

<div class="column" markdown="1">
Repetitive negative thoughts, or perseverative thoughts (PT), are a significant feature of many mental disorders and a strong predictor of poor clinical outcomes. Despite their recognized importance as a source of impairment and an intervention target, PT remains challenging to treat. In this study, we used network control theory (NCT) analysis to investigate whether individuals with clinical levels of perseveration exhibit more temporally persistent brain states when they need to 'turn off' negative thoughts to perform a basic cognitive task. I was responsible for documenting, wrangling, and engineering the behavioral and fMRI dataset.

I conducted A/B testing on a novel neurostimulation device (transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS) to examine its effects and safety in enhancing cognitive abilities in younger adults, particularly focusing on attentional allocation. Specifically, I explored whether an electric intensity lower than 0.5mA could influence the activity of the default mode network (DMN) in the brain. Using group independent component analysis (ICA), I found that low-intensity tDCS altered the intrinsic co-activation of brain regions within the DMN.
