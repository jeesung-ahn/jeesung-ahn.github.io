<h1 class="h1" style="color: rgb(0,0,0)" id="about"> About Me </h1>

Hi there! I’m Jeesung Ahn, a postdoctoral fellow at the [Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/centers/communication-neuroscience-lab), working with [Dr. Emily Falk](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/emily-falk-phd). I’m passionate about using data and science to make a positive impact on people’s lives!

My research primarily focuses on understanding and enhancing social connections, tackling loneliness, and improving mental health. I’m particularly interested in identifying factors that increase the risk of loneliness and understanding the brain’s role in our social connections and isolation.

Additionally, I build models to evaluate how behavioral interventions can promote healthier behaviors, such as increasing physical activity. By leading multidisciplinary research projects, I aim to develop personalized strategies to enhance both physical and mental well-being.

As a health psychologist and neuroscientist, I strive to bridge the gap between data-driven insights and real-world applications, contributing to a healthier and more connected society.

<h1 class="h1" style="color: rgb(0,0,0)" id="methods summary"> Research Methods  </h1>

Over the course of 9+ years leading end-to-end psychology and neuroscience research projects, I have primarily worked with human behavioral and neuroimaging data. 
<br>
<br /> 
**My research methods are multi-disciplinary** and include the followings: 
- experimental and survey design (including A/B tests, usability tests)
- data collection (recruiting, screening, survey, experimental, behavioral, neuroimaging, experience sampling, in-depth interview)
- descriptive / parametric / non-parametric / multivariate statistics
- regression (e.g., general linear modeling)
- multilevel modeling
- time-series analysis
- signal processing (e.g., denoising, despiking, temporal filtering of fMRI signals)
- computational network analysis
- machine-learning classification (supervised / unsupervised learning)
- meta-analysis of multidimensional datasets
- qualitative content analysis (including text analysis)

 In this *mega-analysis* of neuroimaging (fMRI) and physical activity behavioral datasets (N=366), I found the effectiveness of health message interventions in promoting physical activity can be predicted by interactions between message-level (i.e., gain vs. loss framing) and individual-level (i.e., baseline levels of physical activity) characteristics.

My goal was to create a data-driven algorithm that provides personalized food recommendations based on an individual’s dietary needs. I performed exploratory data analyses and unsupervised machine learning (PCA, K-means clustering using R) on a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/nutrient-data/canadian-nutrient-file-2015-download-files.html">dataset</a> with 5690 (food) x 154 (nutrients) dimensions. As a result, I was able to cluster 5690 food items into 8 categories and simulate real-world examples where I give food recommendations to individuals who are in need of dietary restrictions.

<div class="column" markdown="1">
I tested whether neural responses to peers' faces predict the likelihood of becoming lonelier from before to after the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggested that lonelier individuals may assign greater emotional salience to self-relevant social stimuli. Furthermore, individuals who showed greater reward sensitivity to peers' faces were more likely to become lonely in response to social stressors such as social isolation during the pandemic.

In this large-scale multi-disciplinary study, we adopted Round Robin design where entire members of campus social groups were recruited. Participants rated themselves and their peers' social status such as likability, attractiveness, and influence over others. Here, I asked three questions: 1) is there a discrepancy between social status that is evaluated by self *vs.* peers?; 2) would under (or over)-evaluating one's social status be associated with poorer mental health?; 3) would under (or over)-evaluating one's social status be associated with thinking more about *others'* thoughts and feelings?

<div class="column" markdown="1"> I designed and conducted A/B tests for a mobile application that provides cognitive training to modify attentional bias towards negative social stimuli (*Attentional Bias Modification, ABM*). I recruited healthy controls, individuals who have social anxiety, and service workers who were undergoing extreme emotional load at workplaces. Participants performed the ABM task inside the fMRI scanner as well as on their smartphones. We conducted machine-learning classification of brain functional connectivity networks when participants were performing the ABM task and found socially distressed individuals show attentional bias to negative faces (*vs.* neutral faces) both at the behavioral and neural levels.

<div class="column" markdown="1">
I qualitatively reviewed literature that examined the effects of interventions that are designed to tackle two important public health matters: physical inactivity and loneliness. My aim was to identify which aspects of intervention most effectively improve physical inactivity and/or loneliness and whether these two variables are bi-directionally related. I proposed a psychological framework that suggests how *positive social experience* may underlie the relationship between loneliness and physical activity.

<div class="column" markdown="1">*(I was in charge of documenting, wrangling, and engineering behavioral and fMRI datasets.)*<br>
Repetitive negative thoughts (perseverance thought, PT) are a prominent feature of many mental disorders and a robust predictor of poor clinical outcomes. Although the importance of PT as a source of impairment and an intervention target is well-recognized, it remains a difficult problem to treat. A major obstacle is our very limited understanding of what happens when people perseverate. In this study, we adopted the network control theory (NCT) analysis to examine whether clinical perseverators exhibit more temporally persistent brain states when they have to "turn off" negative thoughts in order to perform a basic cognitive task.

I conducted A/B testing of a novel neurostimulation device (transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS) and examined its effects and safety on enhancing younger adults’ cognitive abilities, with a particular focus on attentional allocation abilities. More specifically, I examined whether an electric intensity lower than 0.5mA can influence the activity of the default mode network (DMN) in the brain. I applied a group independent component analysis (ICA) and found the low-intensity tDCS altered the intrinsic co-activation of brain regions within DMN.
