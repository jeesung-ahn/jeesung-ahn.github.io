<h1 class="h1" style="color: rgb(0,0,0)" id="about"> About Me </h1>

Welcome! My name is **Jeesung** Ahn, and I am a 4th-year **Ph.D. candidate** in **Psychology** at the University of Pennsylvania, working with [Dr. Emily Falk](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/emily-falk-phd) at the [Communication Neuroscience Lab](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/centers/communication-neuroscience-lab) (expected graduation in May 2024).

My doctoral research focuses on the domain of **experimental psychology** and **social & health neuroscience**. I am passionate about making data-driven predictions on how **health interventions** can effectively improve **physical and mental well-being** at the individual- and population-level.
<br>
<br>
More specifically, my current research mainly revolves around two topics: 
<br>
- developing **brain-based computational models** to evaluate the **effectiveness of persuasive health message interventions** in promoting health behaviors (e.g., physical activity) 
- explaining individual differences in **mental health (e.g., loneliness)** based on **brain network and social network** characteristics
<br>

All in all, I am a curious and collaborative scholar who is ready to solve real-world problems with data and science!

 In this *mega-analysis* of neuroimaging (fMRI) and physical activity behavioral datasets (N=366), we found the effectiveness of health message interventions in promoting physical activity can be predicted by interactions between message-level (i.e., gain vs. loss framing) and individual-level (i.e., baseline levels of physical activity) characteristics.

Our goal was to create a data-driven algorithm that provides personalized food recommendations based on an individual’s dietary needs. We performed exploratory data analyses and unsupervised machine learning (PCA, K-means clustering using R) on a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/nutrient-data/canadian-nutrient-file-2015-download-files.html">dataset</a> with 5690 (food) x 154 (nutrients) dimensions. As a result, we were able to cluster 5690 food items into 8 categories and simulate real-world examples where we give food recommendations to individuals who are in need of dietary restrictions.

<div class="column" markdown="1">
We tested whether neural responses to peers' faces predict the likelihood of becoming lonelier from before to after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggested that lonelier individuals may assign greater emotional salience to self-relevant social stimuli. Furthermore, individuals who showed greater reward sensitivity to peers' faces were more likely to become lonely in response to social stressors such as social isolation during the pandemic.

In this study, we adopted Round Robin design where entire members of campus social groups were recruited. Participants rated themselves and their peers' social status such as likability, attractiveness, and influence over others. Here, we asked three questions: 1) is there a discrepancy between social status that are evaluated by self *vs.* peers?; 2) would under (or over)-evaluating one's social status be associated with poorer mental health?; 3) would under (or over)-evaluating one's social status be associated with thinking more about *others'* thoughts and feelings?

<div class="column" markdown="1">We conducted A/B tests and usability studies of a mobile application that provides cognitive training to modify attentional bias towards negative social stimuli (*Attentional Bias Modification, ABM*). We recruited healthy controls, individuals with social anxiety, and service workers who undergo extreme emotional load at workplaces. Participants performed the ABM task inside the fMRI scanner as well as on their smartphones. We conducted machine-learning classification of brain functional connectivity networks when performing the ABM task and found socially distressed individuals show attentional bias to negative faces (*vs.* neutral faces) both at the behavioral and neural levels.

We qualitatively reviewed literature that examined the effects of interventions that are designed to tackle two important public health matters: physical inactivity and loneliness. Our aim was to identify which aspects of intervention most effectively improve physical inactivity and/or loneliness and whether these two variables are bi-directionally related. We proposed a psychological framework that suggests how *social influences* may underlie the relationship between loneliness and physical activity.

<div class="column" markdown="1">
Repetitive negative thoughts (perseverance thought, PT) are a prominent feature of many mental disorders and a robust predictor of poor clinical outcomes. Although the importance of PT as a source of impairment and an intervention target is well-recognized, it remains a difficult problem to treat. A major obstacle is our very limited understanding of what happens when people perseverate. In this study, we adopted the network control theory (NCT) analysis to examine whether clinical perseverators exhibit more temporally persistent brain states when they have to "turn off" negative thoughts in order to perform a basic cognitive task. <br><br> *I was in charge of engineering, wrangling, and documenting the experimental fMRI dataset.*

We investigated whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with an electric intensity lower than 0.5mA can influence the activity of the default mode network (DMN) in the brain. We applied group independent component analysis (ICA) and found the low-intensity tDCS altered the intrinsic co-activation of brain regions within DMN. We also conducted A/B tests and usability studies of a novel tDCS device and examined its effects and safety on enhancing young adults' cognitive abilities, with a particular focus on attentional allocation and memory.
